# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

If you have a suggestion but do not know (or do not want to) add a merge-request,
please open an issue. The maintainers will judge if the suggestion is worth
adding.

To speed things along, create a merge-request yourself that adds the suggestion.

In order to guarantee an equal opportunity for all entries, please ensure your
merge-request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Entries within each section are placed in alphabetical order. When adding a
   new entry, make sure it is in the appropriate place.

2. The entry should contain a name, link, and brief description, with the item
   link and description separated with a dash. It should look like this:
   ```
   - [Some Project](https://example/com/projects/some) - A project that does a thing
   ```

3. For the sake of readability of the source file, keep lines shorter than 80
   characters. If a line is longer than 80 characters, please break it across a
   new line. How the line is split up is left to the author.

   For example:

   ```
   - [Some Project](https://example/com/projects/with-some-very-long-url)
     \- A project that does a thing
   ```

4. If, besides the main link, an entry has more links (for instance a related
   blog post, Github organization, or a source code repository), please add a
   link to those as well. The web presence should come first. Other links should
   be added last, after the description, each on their own line.

   The format is:
   ```
   - [Some Project](https://example/com/projects/some) - A project that does a thing
    ([blog](https://blog.example.com/some-project))
    ([repo](https://github.com/example/repo))
   ```

5. If an entry's main link is a blog post or article, please provide the year in
   which it was written, outside of the linked text. For non-main links this is
   not needed, as that would add too much distraction.

   Format:
   ```
      - [Some Blog Post](https://blog.example.com/some) (2020) About something.
   ```

6. If the entry does not comfortably fit in any of the existing sections, feel
   free create a new section more to your liking!

7. If the entry is part of an existing section that covers several topics,
   feel free to split the section into several sections if things become too
   crowded.

8. Sections are placed in alphabetical order. Take this into account when adding
   a new section.

9. This list is not meant for self-promotion. As Solid is still fairly young, we
   understand the need to attain more exposure. If you _are_ the author of the
   item you are suggesting, take extra care to explain in your merge-request
   _why_ your entry is  awesome for others. No sales pitch, just the (awesome)
   facts, please!

Thank you for your suggestions and for following these guidelines!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a merge-request adhere to the standards above can be
difficult.

If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your merge-request before we merge it. There's no need to open a new
 merge-request, just edit the existing one.

If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your merge-request so that we can merge it.
